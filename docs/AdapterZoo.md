You can download the adapters from <https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/T2I-Adapter/tree/main>

All the following adapters are trained with Stable Diffusion (SD) V1.4, and they can be directly used on custom models as long as they are fine-tuned from the same text-to-image models, such as Anything-4.0 or models on the <https://civitai.com/>.

| Adapter Name  | Adapter Description | |
